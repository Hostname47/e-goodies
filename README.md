# ðŸš€ E-Goodies Project

A **collaborative full-stack application** built with **React** (frontend) and a robust backend stack centered on **Symfony**, fully containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated by **Kubernetes** for easy setup and deployment.

## Notes

Frontend project needs to be run on  development server locally, and so you need to run the following:

```bash
cd software/frontend && npm run dev
```
